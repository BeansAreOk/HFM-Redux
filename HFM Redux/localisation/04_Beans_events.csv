EVTNAME998001;The Battle of Isandlwana;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC998001;The Battle of Isandlwana would be the first major encounter between the British forces and the Zulu Kingdom, with the Zulu forces outnumbering the British over tenfold. In the battle both of the British Commanding Officers Bvt. Lt-Col Henry Pulleine and Bvt. Col. Anthony Durnford would be killed and this defeat would prove a devastating blow to Britain's first invasion into Zululand and their colonial prestige. The failures of The Battle of Isandlwana would only be slightly remedied by Britain's victory against all odds at Rorke's Drift the same day.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME99809;The Battle of Rorke's Drift;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99809;Following disaster at the initial invasion, British forces in Zululand were scattered. At Rorke's Drift, a field supply depot and hospital, a small force under Lt. Gonville Bromhead received news of a large Zulu force approaching. Noting that a small column, travelling in open country and burdened with carts of the wounded, would be easily overran by a numerically superior Zulu force, the only choice was to remain and fight.\n\nIn the end, just over 150 British and colonial troops successfully defended the garrison against an assault by 4,000 Zulus. The massive but piecemeal Zulu attacks on Rorke's Drift came very close to defeating the much smaller garrison, but were ultimately repelled. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders, along with a number of other decorations and honours.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME9980002;The Battle of May Island;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC9980002;The Battle of May Island was a series of naval accidents made by the Royal Navy that occured during Operation E.C.1 during the First World War. In the waters off of the Isle of May, five collisions would occur between eight ships, with two of the unreliable British K-class submarines being lost. The Battle of May Island led to the deaths of 105 British sailors, both the investigation and court marshall following these incidents were kept quiet with much of the information being withheld until 1994, to avoid embarrassment to the Navy.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME99810003;The Flannan Isles Lighthouse Mystery ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99810003;On December 26th 1900, the Lighthouse Relief ship called the Hesperus was sent to investigate disturbances to the operation of the lighthouse on the Flannan Isles. As the ship approached, the captain, James Harvey, observed that no supplies or lighthouse keepers were waiting on shore to greet him. Upon further investigation, the beds of the lighthouse crewmembers were unmade and the clocks were no longer working. There was no sign of the three missing lighthouse keepers Ducat, Marshal or McArthur. The lamps had been cleaned and filled with oil and the waterproof clothing was left hanging. Although it is not known for sure what happened to the lighthouse keepers, it is believed that the keepers were swept out to sea by a wave created by a large storm.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME99810005;The Villisca Axe Murders;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99810005;On the morning of June 10th 1912 in Villisca, Iowa, something terrible would be uncovered. The Moore family and two of their guests would be found brutally murdered by an axe after their neighbour became concerned and investigated. It was discovered that there was someone murdered in every bed in the house, the parents of the Moore's family had their head struck at least thirty times, with Sarah Moore having clear slices in her unrecognisable face. The other victims were beaten with the blunt end of the axe instead. When the local Marshall, Hank Horton, left the scene to get a doctor, he made the great mistake of mentioning to the local townspeople of the shocking event as well. This would cause mass panic in the community with over a hundred locals storming into the house of the Moore family to gawk at the bodies, and possibly disturbing evidence. There would be plenty of potential suspects that were questioned, one of which was tried twice but ended in acquittal. This crime still remains unsolved.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME99810007;The Crash at Crush!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99810007;Crush was a temporary city in Texas that only existed for one day on September 15th, 1896. It was run by its founder William George Crush, who worked as Passanger Traffic Manager of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway Company. The city's sole purpose was for the spectacle of watching two trains collide, known as the "Crash at Crush". forty thousand spectators came to watch the event, making Crush City the second largest city in Texas at the time. When the time finally came at 5pm, William Crush signalled the two trains to go. The two 35 tonne locomotives raced at each other at speeds of over 55 miles per hour. The impact caused the trains to rear onto each other, before falling onto their sides, the boilers of both trains soon exploded. Causing large fragments of debris to be released at high speeds, killing 2 spectators and injuring dozens of others. The railroad company fired George Crush, but he was rehired the next day after the railroad company received positive publicity and worldwide recognition from the event. ;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC99810015;A crash between a Norwegian steamer and a military supply ship at our vital port in Halifax has led to a tragedy on unprecedented scale. Our ship, carrying 200 tons of TNT, 35 tons of high-octane gasoline and 10 tons of gun cotton, caused the biggest explosion that humanity has ever witnessed at the force of 3 kilotons of TNT. The explosion vaporised the water caught in its blast, leaving the harbour floor momentarily exposed. A tsunami which reached as high as 60 feet was created, which filled the empty space. 1600 people were killed instantly, 9000 were left injured including around 200 people which were left blind.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME99810019;The Failure of the North Pole Balloon Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99810019;A journey to be the first to reach the North Pole via hot-air balloon travel was the brainchild of Salomon August Andree, a Swedish mechanical engineer who was fascinated with balloon travel. By 1896, S. A. Andree's plan to be the first to reach the North Pole was so popular that he managed to secure funding from Oscar II. Despite a first expedition with slight failure, the expedition would begin again in July 1897. However, it would soon be made clear that the engineers had not tested the capabilities of the balloon in cold weather, leading to the balloon losing hydrogen quickly and being unable to steer. Furthermore, Andree decided to use a method of steering he had invented himself by using 3 long ropes to drag along the ice, and shortly after taking off, the balloon had lost 2 of the ropes already. After 65 hours of flight, the balloon was taken out by an arctic storm, crashing in Svalbard, sealing the fate of the three Swedish explorers.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC99810021;On the island of Kvitoya in Svalbard, the ruins of the failed balloon expedition to the North Pole in 1897 were found. The men had survived for 2 months after their crash landing and settled at Kvitoya, where they eventually died. It is believed that the group of explorers perished after consuming polar bear meat, which is very parasitic. The bodies of the 3 men were discovered along with a diary and camera film of their doomed journey to the North Pole. The bodies of Andree, Fraenkel and Strindberg were taken back to Stockholm for a proper burial.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTNAME123593;The Entente Cordiale;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC123594;The Entente Cordiale was a series of agreements signed between the United Kingdom and France. The beginning of the 20th century saw both nations diplomatically isolated from other European powers, France by the skillful German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and the United Kingdom by their own choice of "Splendid Isolationism". With the balance of power shifting it would be wise to reconcile the rift that has existed between the British and French peoples for generations.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
